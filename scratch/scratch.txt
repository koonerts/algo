Hey Anna,

I appreciate you reaching out and apologies on the delay!

I had some unexpected personal matters crop up so I was back in Ohio for a bit (with a slight hiatus on interview prep as well).

After taking a look at the link provided, I would definitely have interest in either the
Storage/Search Infra or Data Productivity roles.

However, I'm ideally looking to schedule any OA or initial interviews for early April, if that timeline isn't a concern.

I can go ahead and apply to those roles in the near future if that's best and we can definitely have a catch up before that as well.

Thanks,
Tj Kooner
