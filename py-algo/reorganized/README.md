# Python Algorithm Problems

This repository contains a collection of common algorithm problems and their Python implementations, organized by category.

## Structure

Each problem is contained in its own file with:
- Descriptive docstring explaining the problem statement
- Implementation of one or more solutions
- Example usage with test cases
- Time and space complexity analysis (where applicable)

## Getting Started

To run any problem solution:

```python
python filename.py
```

Each file can be run independently and includes test cases in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

## Contributing
