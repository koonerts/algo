Find_smallest_range

Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the ‘M’ lists.

    Example 1:
    Input: L1=[1, 5, 8], L2=[4, 12], L3=[7, 8, 10]
    Output: [4, 7]
    Explanation: The range [4, 7] includes 5 from L1, 4 from L2 and 7 from L3.

    Example 2:
    Input: L1=[1, 9], L2=[4, 12], L3=[7, 10, 16]
    Output: [9, 12]
    Explanation: The range [9, 12] includes 9 from L1, 12 from L2 and 10 from L3.
