Count_rotations

Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and is rotated ‘k’ times around a pivot, find ‘k’.
    You can assume that the array does not have any duplicates.

    Example 1:
    Input: [10, 15, 1, 3, 8]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The array has been rotated 2 times.

    Input: [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, -1, 2]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The array has been rotated 5 times.
