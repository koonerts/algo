Count_trees

Given a number ‘n’, write a function to return the count of structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BST) that can store values 1 to ‘n’.

    Example 1:
    Input: 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: As we saw in the previous problem, there are 2 unique BSTs storing numbers from 1-2.

    Example 2:
    Input: 3
    Output: 5
    Explanation: There will be 5 unique BSTs that can store numbers from 1 to 3.
