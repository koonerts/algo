# High ROI Patterns

## Two Pointers

### 1. Two Pointers (Opposite Direction)

**You need to find if there's a pair of elements in a sorted array that sum to a target value.**

- [ ] A. Use a hash map to track seen values
- [ ] B. Use a sliding window with variable size
- [ ] C. Use two pointers starting from both ends of the array
- [ ] D. Use binary search on each element

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use two pointers starting from both ends of the array**

Since the array is sorted, we can use two pointers - one at the beginning and one at the end. If their sum is too large, we move the right pointer left; if too small, we move the left pointer right. This gives us O(n) time complexity.
</details>

---

### 2. Two Pointers (Same Direction)

**Find the longest subarray containing only 1's after flipping at most k 0's to 1's.**

- [ ] A. Use a dynamic programming approach with a 2D array
- [ ] B. Use a sliding window with two pointers tracking a valid segment
- [ ] C. Use binary search to find the optimal subarray length
- [ ] D. Use a greedy approach flipping the first k zeros

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Use a sliding window with two pointers tracking a valid segment**

This is a classic sliding window problem with two pointers moving in the same direction. We maintain a window where we've flipped at most k zeros, expanding the right pointer and contracting the left pointer when necessary to maintain our constraint.
</details>

---

## Sliding Window

### 3. Sliding Window (Fixed Size)

**Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of fixed size k in an array.**

- [ ] A. Sort the array and take the last k elements
- [ ] B. Use a queue to track elements in the current window
- [ ] C. Maintain a fixed-size sliding window, subtracting old values and adding new ones
- [ ] D. Create a prefix sum array and calculate differences

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Maintain a fixed-size sliding window, subtracting old values and adding new ones**

With a fixed-size sliding window, we start by calculating the sum of the first k elements. Then, as we slide the window, we subtract the element leaving the window and add the element entering the window, keeping track of the maximum sum seen.
</details>

---

### 4. Sliding Window (Variable Size)

**Find the shortest subarray with a sum at least k.**

- [ ] A. Use binary search to find the minimum length
- [ ] B. Sort the array and use two pointers
- [ ] C. Use dynamic programming with an array of minimum lengths
- [ ] D. Use a sliding window that expands and contracts based on the current sum

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**D. Use a sliding window that expands and contracts based on the current sum**

We use a variable-size sliding window. We expand the window by moving the right pointer until the sum is at least k, then contract it by moving the left pointer while maintaining the sum â‰¥ k. At each valid window, we update the minimum length.
</details>

---

### 5. Sliding Window (Variable Size - Alternative)

**Find the length of the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to a given value.**

- [ ] A. Use two pointers to define a window, expand until invalid, then contract
- [ ] B. Build a trie to store all possible subarrays
- [ ] C. Sort the array and use binary search
- [ ] D. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**A. Use two pointers to define a window, expand until invalid, then contract**

This is a classic variable-size sliding window problem. We maintain a window using two pointers and a running sum. We expand the window by moving the right pointer until the sum exceeds our target, then contract by moving the left pointer until valid again, tracking the maximum valid window size.
</details>

---

- [ ] D. Apply a dynamic programming approach with memoization

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Use a level-order traversal with a queue, tracking level sums**

BFS is perfect for level-order traversal. We use a queue to process nodes level by level, calculating the sum at each level and tracking the maximum sum level.

- [ ] C. Calculate width recursively using the height
- [ ] D. Convert the tree to an array representation

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Use level-order traversal (BFS) with node counting per level**

BFS is naturally level-by-level. We use a queue to process nodes level by level, keeping track of the number of nodes at each level. The maximum of these counts is the tree's width.
</details>

- [ ] C. Use breadth-first search with a queue and visited set
- [ ] D. Use Union-Find to determine connectivity

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use breadth-first search with a queue and visited set**

For unweighted graphs, BFS naturally finds the shortest path by processing nodes in order of their distance from the start node. We use a queue and a visited set to avoid cycles.
</details>

---

### 9. Breadth-First Search (Grid Graphs)

**Find the shortest path from start to end in a grid where some cells are blocked.**

- [ ] A. Use DFS with a visited set to find all possible paths
- [ ] B. Use BFS to explore cells level by level until reaching the end
- [ ] C. Use Dijkstra's algorithm with a modified heuristic
- [ ] D. Use A* search with Manhattan distance

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Use BFS to explore cells level by level until reaching the end**

For unweighted graphs (where each step has the same cost), BFS naturally finds the shortest path by exploring nodes in order of their distance from the start. We use a queue and a visited set to avoid revisiting cells.
</details>

- [ ] D. Apply the Union-Find algorithm to detect cycles

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**A. Do an inorder traversal and verify if the result is sorted**

This is one approach. Alternatively, we can use DFS with min/max constraints, where each node's value must be within a range determined by its ancestors. For a BST, inorder traversal produces elements in sorted order.
</details>

---

### 11. Depth-First Search (Trees - Balance)

**Check if a binary tree is balanced (the depth of any two leaf nodes differs by at most 1).**

- [ ] A. Compare the depths of every pair of leaf nodes
- [ ] B. Use BFS to check if the tree is complete
- [ ] C. Use bottom-up DFS to calculate heights and check balance
- [ ] D. Count nodes at each level and verify even distribution

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use bottom-up DFS to calculate heights and check balance**

Use post-order traversal (a type of DFS) to compute heights bottom-up. For each node, calculate the height of left and right subtrees. If their difference exceeds 1, the tree is unbalanced. This way, we can check balance in a single pass.
</details>

---

### 12. Depth-First Search (Graphs)

- [ ] D. Calculate the transitive closure of the graph

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Use DFS with recursion or a stack from the source node**

DFS can be used to check if there's a path from source to destination. We recursively explore all paths from the source, marking nodes as visited, until we either find the destination or exhaust all possibilities.
</details>

---

### 13. Depth-First Search (Cycle Detection)

**Detect if a directed graph has a cycle.**

- [ ] A. Use a union-find data structure
- [ ] B. Apply BFS and count nodes at each level

- [ ] D. Sort the adjacency list and check for repeated edges

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use DFS with three node states: unvisited, in-progress, and visited**

To detect cycles in a directed graph using DFS, we maintain three states for nodes: unvisited, in-progress (in the current DFS path), and visited (finished processing). If we encounter an in-progress node during DFS, we've found a cycle.
</details>

---

## Backtracking

- [ ] D. Build a mathematical formula to calculate all combinations

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use recursion with backtracking, adding and removing elements**

Backtracking is perfect for generating all combinations. We recursively build combinations by adding one element at a time, exploring all possibilities, and backtracking by removing the last element before trying the next option.
</details>

---

### 15. Backtracking (Subsets)

**Generate all possible subsets of a set of distinct integers.**

- [ ] A. Use bit manipulation to represent all subsets
- [ ] B. Use a mathematical formula for combinations

For each position, we try all possible characters that can be placed there (by swapping with the current character). Then we recursively generate all permutations for the remaining positions. After the recursive call, we backtrack by swapping back.
</details>

---

### 17. Backtracking (Constraint Satisfaction)

**Solve a Sudoku puzzle.**

- [ ] A. Use a greedy algorithm to fill in obvious cells first

For each empty cell, we try all valid digits (1-9) that don't violate Sudoku constraints (row, column, and 3x3 box). After placing a digit, we recursively try to solve the rest of the puzzle. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and try a different digit.
</details>

- [ ] D. Calculate mathematically using combinatorics

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use backtracking with constraint checking and counting valid arrangements**

The N-Queens problem is a classic backtracking problem. We place queens one row at a time, checking if each position is valid (not threatened by previously placed queens). We backtrack when necessary and count all valid arrangements.
</details>

- [ ] C. Use interpolation search based on values distribution
- [ ] D. Use exponential search followed by binary search

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Use binary search, repeatedly dividing the search space in half**

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half until the target is found or the subarray size becomes zero.
</details>

---

### 20. Binary Search (Boundary)

- [ ] D. Sort the array indices by value and find the smallest index

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use binary search but continue leftward even after finding a match**

Standard binary search finds any occurrence. To find the first occurrence, when we find a match, we don't stop but instead continue searching in the left half (by setting right = mid - 1). We also remember this position as a potential answer.
</details>

---

### 21. Binary Search (Rotated Array)

**Find a value in a sorted array that was rotated at an unknown pivot point.**

- [ ] A. First find the pivot, then perform binary search on the appropriate half
- [ ] B. Modified binary search that handles the rotation internally
- [ ] C. Search both halves of the array using regular binary search
- [ ] D. Convert to a normal sorted array first, then use standard binary search

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Modified binary search that handles the rotation internally**

We use a modified binary search. At each step, we determine which half of the array is sorted. If the target is in the range of the sorted half, we search there; otherwise, we search the other half. This preserves the O(log n) time complexity.
</details>

---

### 22. Binary Search (On Answer)

**Find the minimum capacity of ships needed to transport packages within a given number of days.**

- [ ] A. Use dynamic programming to find optimal distribution
- [ ] B. Use a greedy approach assigning packages sequentially
- [ ] C. Binary search on the potential capacity values
- [ ] D. Sort packages and assign to ships using two pointers

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Binary search on the potential capacity values**

Instead of searching for a value in an array, we binary search on the potential answer space (possible capacity values). For each capacity, we check if it's feasible (can ship all packages within the day limit). The minimum feasible capacity is our answer.
</details>

---

### 23. Binary Search (First Bad Version)

- [ ] D. Use two pointers to partition the array around k

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Maintain a min-heap of size k while processing the array**

To find the k largest elements, we can maintain a min-heap of size k. For each element, we add it to the heap and remove the smallest element if the heap size exceeds k. This gives us O(n log k) time complexity.
</details>

---

### 25. Heap (Two Heaps)

**Find the median of a data stream.**

- [ ] A. Sort the stream after each addition
- [ ] B. Maintain a balanced binary search tree
- [ ] C. Use two heaps: a max-heap for the smaller half and a min-heap for the larger half
- [ ] D. Track the sum and count to calculate average

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use two heaps: a max-heap for the smaller half and a min-heap for the larger half**

We maintain two heaps: a max-heap for the smaller half of the numbers and a min-heap for the larger half. We balance the heaps so their sizes differ by at most 1, allowing us to find the median in O(1) time after insertion.
</details>

---

## Binary Search Tree

- [ ] D. Convert the BST to a sorted array and return the kth element

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**A. Do an inorder traversal and return the kth element**

Since inorder traversal of a BST visits nodes in ascending order, we can simply perform an inorder traversal and return the kth element visited.
</details>

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Use fast and slow pointers to detect a cycle**

The Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (tortoise and hare) uses two pointers moving at different speeds. If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.
</details>

---

### 28. Fast & Slow Pointers (Middle Finding)

**Find the middle node of a linked list in a single pass.**

- [ ] A. First count the nodes, then traverse to the middle
- [ ] B. Use recursion to find the depth and middle node simultaneously

- [ ] D. Use a stack to store nodes and find the middle

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use a slow pointer and a fast pointer that moves twice as fast**

When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle. The fast pointer moves two steps for every one step of the slow pointer. When the fast pointer reaches the end (or null), the slow pointer will be at the middle.
</details>

**C. Use a stack to keep track of elements waiting for their next greater element**

A monotonic stack is perfect for this problem. We maintain a stack of elements waiting for their next greater element. When we encounter a greater element, we pop from the stack and update their results.

## Topological Sort

### 43. Topological Sort

**Given a list of tasks with dependencies, find a valid order to complete all tasks.**

- [ ] A. Sort the tasks by their number of dependencies
- [ ] B. Use DFS to explore the dependency graph and detect cycles

**C. Apply BFS with indegree tracking to build the topological order**

Topological sorting can be implemented using BFS with indegree tracking. We start with nodes that have no dependencies (indegree=0), remove them, update the indegrees of their neighbors, and continue until all nodes are processed or we detect a cycle.

## Linked List Techniques

### 44. Linked List Reversal

**Reverse a linked list.**

- [ ] A. Use a stack to store nodes and rebuild in reverse order
- [ ] B. Maintain three pointers (prev, current, next) and reverse links
- [ ] C. Use a queue to reorder nodes
- [ ] D. Create a new list in reverse order

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Maintain three pointers (prev, current, next) and reverse links**

The iterative approach to reversing a linked list involves maintaining three pointers: prev, current, and next. We traverse the list once, reversing the next pointer of each node to point to the previous node.

### 45. Linked List Reversal (Advanced)

**Reverse nodes in a linked list in groups of k.**

- [ ] A. Use recursion to reverse each group and connect them
- [ ] B. Create k separate lists and then merge them
- [ ] C. Use a stack to reverse every k elements
- [ ] D. Count nodes first, then reverse only complete groups

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**A. Use recursion to reverse each group and connect them**

We recursively reverse the first k nodes using the same technique as reversing a whole linked list. Then, we connect the reversed part with the recursively processed rest of the list (which will have its own k-groups reversed).

## Prefix Sums

### 46. Prefix Sums (Subarray Sum)

**Find the number of subarrays with a sum equal to a given target.**

- [ ] A. Use a sliding window with variable size
- [ ] B. Apply two pointers to track subarray boundaries
- [ ] C. Use a hash map to store prefix sums and their frequencies
- [ ] D. Sort the array and use binary search

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use a hash map to store prefix sums and their frequencies**

We calculate the prefix sum while iterating through the array. For each position, we check if (prefix_sum - target) exists in our hash map, which would indicate a subarray with the target sum ending at the current position.

## Bit Manipulation

### 47. Bit Manipulation (XOR Technique)

**Find the single number in an array where every other number appears twice.**

- [ ] A. Sort the array and check adjacent elements
- [ ] B. Use a hash map to count occurrences
- [ ] C. Apply XOR to all elements in the array
- [ ] D. Use a binary search tree to track unique elements

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Apply XOR to all elements in the array**

This is a classic bit manipulation problem. XORing a number with itself results in 0, and XORing with 0 leaves the number unchanged. By XORing all elements, the duplicates cancel out, leaving only the single number.
</details>

### 48. Bit Manipulation (Advanced)

**Find the only element that appears once in an array where all other elements appear exactly three times.**

- [ ] A. Sort the array and check adjacent elements
- [ ] B. Use a hash map to count occurrences
- [ ] C. Use bit manipulation to count bits modulo 3
- [ ] D. Use a mathematical formula with sums

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use bit manipulation to count bits modulo 3**

We count the number of 1s at each bit position for all numbers. Since each bit of a number that appears three times contributes either 0 or 3 to the count, the bits from the unique number will make the count not divisible by 3. We construct our answer from these bits.

- [ ] D. Apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm for shortest paths

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue**

Dijkstra's algorithm is designed for this exact problem. It uses a priority queue to always process the node with the smallest current distance, guaranteeing the shortest path to each node.

### 50. Graph Coloring

**Determine if a graph can be colored with at most 2 colors such that no adjacent vertices have the same color.**

- [ ] A. Use a greedy algorithm to assign colors
- [ ] B. Apply BFS/DFS to color vertices and check for conflicts
- [ ] C. Use Union-Find to detect odd-length cycles
- [ ] D. Sort vertices by degree and color in order

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Apply BFS/DFS to color vertices and check for conflicts**

This is a bipartite graph check. We use BFS or DFS to color the graph with 2 colors, alternating colors for adjacent vertices. If at any point we can't assign a different color to an adjacent vertex, the graph is not bipartite.

## Advanced Data Structures

### 51. Design Problems (LRU Cache)

**Implement a data structure for an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.**

- [ ] A. Use a simple array with linear search for access
- [ ] B. Implement with a balanced binary search tree
- [ ] C. Use a hash map combined with a doubly linked list
- [ ] D. Use a priority queue based on access timestamps

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use a hash map combined with a doubly linked list**

An efficient LRU cache combines a hash map for O(1) lookups with a doubly linked list to maintain order of use. When an item is accessed, it's moved to the front of the list (most recently used). When capacity is reached, we remove the item at the end of the list (least recently used).

### 52. Advanced Data Structures (Segment Tree)

**Which data structure would be most efficient for range queries and updates on an array?**

- [ ] A. Binary search tree
- [ ] B. Hash table
- [ ] C. Segment tree
- [ ] D. Linked list

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Segment tree**

A segment tree is specialized for range queries and updates. It's a binary tree where each node represents a range of the array. Leaf nodes represent individual elements, and internal nodes represent the combined result (sum, min, max, etc.) of their children. This allows for O(log n) range queries and updates.

## String Algorithms

### 53. String Algorithms (KMP)

**Find all occurrences of a pattern string in a text string efficiently.**

- [ ] A. Use naive approach checking all possible positions
- [ ] B. Apply the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm using partial matches
- [ ] C. Use the Boyer-Moore algorithm with bad character and good suffix rules
- [ ] D. Apply a rolling hash (Rabin-Karp) algorithm

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Apply the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm using partial matches**

KMP avoids unnecessary comparisons by using information from previous matches. It preprocesses the pattern to create a "partial match" table, which indicates how much of the pattern can be skipped when a mismatch occurs. This reduces the time complexity to O(n+m) where n and m are the lengths of text and pattern.
</details>

### 54. String Matching (Approximate)

**Find strings that approximately match a pattern allowing for k errors (edit distance).**

- [ ] A. Use dynamic programming to calculate edit distance for all substrings
- [ ] B. Apply the Rabin-Karp algorithm with hash comparisons
- [ ] C. Use a modified KMP algorithm with allowed errors
- [ ] D. Implement a bit-parallel algorithm like Bitap

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**D. Implement a bit-parallel algorithm like Bitap**

The Bitap algorithm (also known as Shift-OR or Baeza-Yates-Gonnet algorithm) uses bit manipulation for approximate string matching. It can be modified to handle up to k errors by maintaining k+1 bit arrays. This approach is particularly efficient for patterns shorter than the word size.

## Specialized Patterns

### 55. Combinatorial Search

**Generate all possible valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses.**

- [ ] A. Use dynamic programming to build up valid strings
- [ ] B. Apply backtracking ensuring valid balance of parentheses
- [ ] C. Use BFS to build strings level by level
- [ ] D. Create a mathematical formula for Catalan numbers and generate directly

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Apply backtracking ensuring valid balance of parentheses**

We use backtracking with two rules: we can add an opening parenthesis if we haven't used all n, and we can add a closing parenthesis if there are unclosed opening parentheses. This ensures all generated combinations are valid.

### 56. System Design Patterns (Rate Limiter)

**Implement a rate limiter that allows n requests per minute per user.**

- [ ] A. Use a simple counter reset every minute
- [ ] B. Implement a token bucket algorithm
- [ ] C. Use a sliding window with timestamps for each request
- [ ] D. Apply a leaky bucket algorithm that processes requests at a fixed rate

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use a sliding window with timestamps for each request**

A sliding window approach keeps track of timestamps of requests in the last minute. For each new request, we clean out timestamps older than 1 minute and check if the remaining count is less than the limit. This ensures exactly n requests per minute regardless of distribution within the minute.
</details>

### 57. Memory Management (Garbage Collection)

**Which algorithm marks objects for garbage collection by starting from root objects and marking everything reachable?**

- [ ] A. Reference counting
- [ ] B. Mark and sweep
- [ ] C. Generational garbage collection
- [ ] D. Compaction

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Mark and sweep**

Mark and Sweep is a garbage collection algorithm that works in two phases: 1) Mark: start from root objects and recursively mark all reachable objects as "in use" 2) Sweep: scan the entire memory and free any objects not marked as "in use". This identifies and collects all unreachable objects.

### 58. Concurrency Patterns (Reader-Writer Lock)

**Implement a mechanism that allows multiple readers but only one writer to access a resource simultaneously.**

- [ ] A. Use a simple mutex that locks for both readers and writers
- [ ] B. Implement a semaphore with initial value of maximum readers
- [ ] C. Use a reader-writer lock with reader count and writer flag
- [ ] D. Apply the actor model with message passing

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**C. Use a reader-writer lock with reader count and writer flag**

A reader-writer lock allows multiple readers to access the resource simultaneously, but grants exclusive access to writers. It typically uses a mutex to protect a reader count and a writer flag. Readers increment/decrement the count, while writers check for zero readers and set the writer flag.
</details>

---

### 59. Network Flow (Max Flow)

**Find the maximum flow in a flow network from source to sink.**

- [ ] A. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the path with maximum capacity
- [ ] B. Apply the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with augmenting paths
- [ ] C. Use a greedy approach selecting highest capacity edges
- [ ] D. Implement Kruskal's algorithm on flow capacities

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**B. Apply the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with augmenting paths**

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm finds maximum flow by repeatedly finding augmenting paths (paths with available capacity) from source to sink and sending flow through them. We continue until no augmenting path exists. The Edmonds-Karp variant uses BFS to find the shortest augmenting path each time.

### 60. Specialized Trees (B-Tree)

**Which tree structure is commonly used in databases and file systems for efficient disk access?**

- [ ] A. Binary search tree
- [ ] B. Red-black tree
- [ ] C. AVL tree
- [ ] D. B-tree or B+ tree

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>

**D. B-tree or B+ tree**

B-trees and B+ trees are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, like databases and file systems. They have a high branching factor, keeping the tree height small which minimizes disk accesses. B+ trees additionally link the leaves, making range queries more efficient.
