```python
# More efficient implementation
def optimized_implementation(args):
    # code here
    return result
# Time: O(?), Space: O(?)
```

## Common Variations

    return result
```

### Variation 2: [Name]

```python
# Implementation of variation 2
def variation_2(args):
    # code here
    return result
```
