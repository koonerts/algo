## Array Patterns

### Sliding Window Pattern

#### Problem 1: Maximum Average Subarray I

Given an array of integers and an integer k, find the maximum average value of any contiguous subarray of length k.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75
Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

**Question**: Which of the following implementations correctly finds the maximum average of a contiguous subarray of length k?

```python
def findMaxAverage(nums, k):
    # Calculate the sum of first k elements
    current_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    max_sum = current_sum

    # Slide the window and update the maximum sum
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###

    return max_sum / k
```

- [ ] A.

```python
current_sum += nums[i] - nums[i-1]
max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
```

- [ ] B.

```python
current_sum = current_sum - nums[i-k] + nums[i]
max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
```

- [ ] C.

```python
window_sum = sum(nums[i-k+1:i+1])
max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
```

- [ ] D.

```python
current_sum += nums[i]
if i >= k:
    current_sum -= nums[i-k]
max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
current_sum = current_sum - nums[i-k] + nums[i]
max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
```

This implementation correctly slides the window by removing the first element of the previous window and adding the next element of the array. We then update the maximum sum found so far.

The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1), which makes it efficient for large arrays.

#### Problem 2: Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

Example 1:

```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
```

Example 3:

```
Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= target <= 10^9
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

**Question**: Select the correct implementation of a sliding window algorithm to find the minimum size subarray with sum at least `target`.

```python
def minSubArrayLen(target, nums):
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_length = float('inf')

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        # Expand window
        current_sum += nums[right]

        # Shrink window if possible
        ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###

    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  while current_sum >= target:
      min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
      current_sum -= nums[left]
      left += 1
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  if current_sum >= target:
      min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
      current_sum -= nums[left]
      left += 1
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  if current_sum >= target:
      min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  for left in range(len(nums)):
      if current_sum >= target:
          min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
          break
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
while current_sum >= target:
    min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
    current_sum -= nums[left]
    left += 1
```

This implementation continuously shrinks the window from the left side as long as the current sum is greater than or equal to the target. For each valid window, we update the minimum length. This ensures we find the smallest possible window that satisfies the condition.

The time complexity is O(n) as each element is processed at most twice (added and removed from the window once). The space complexity is O(1).

### Two Pointers Pattern

#### Problem 3: Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water (area). Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The container bordered by height indices 1 and 8 (0-indexed) contains 49 units of water.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4

**Question**: Which implementation of the two-pointer approach correctly calculates the maximum area of water the container can hold?

```python
def maxArea(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0

    while left < right:
        ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###

    return max_area
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
  max_area = max(max_area, area)
  if height[left] <= height[right]:
      left += 1
  else:
      right -= 1
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  area = max(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
  max_area = max(max_area, area)
  if height[left] <= height[right]:
      left += 1
  else:
      right -= 1
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
  max_area = max(max_area, area)
  left += 1
  right -= 1
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
  max_area = max(max_area, area)
  if height[left] <= height[right]:
      right -= 1
  else:
      left += 1
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
max_area = max(max_area, area)
if height[left] <= height[right]:
    left += 1
else:
    right -= 1
```

The area of water contained is determined by the minimum height of the two boundaries multiplied by the distance between them. To maximize the area, we should try to maintain the higher boundary and move the shorter one, because:

1. The width decreases with each step
2. Moving the higher boundary can only result in the same or smaller area
3. Moving the shorter boundary gives a chance to find a taller boundary that might increase the area

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the height array, and the space complexity is O(1).

#### Problem 4: Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water are trapped.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

Constraints:

- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5

**Question**: Which implementation correctly uses the two-pointer technique to calculate water trapped between bars?

```python
def trap(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    left_max = right_max = water = 0

    while left < right:
        ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###

    return water
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  if height[left] < height[right]:
      left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
      water += left_max - height[left]
      left += 1
  else:
      right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
      water += right_max - height[right]
      right -= 1
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
  right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
  if left_max < right_max:
      water += left_max - height[left]
      left += 1
  else:
      water += right_max - height[right]
      right -= 1
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  if height[left] < height[right]:
      water += max(0, min(left_max, right_max) - height[left])
      left += 1
  else:
      water += max(0, min(left_max, right_max) - height[right])
      right -= 1
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  water += max(0, min(height[left], height[right]) - min(height[left:right+1]))
  if height[left] < height[right]:
      left += 1
  else:
      right -= 1
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
if height[left] < height[right]:
    left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
    water += left_max - height[left]
    left += 1
else:
    right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
    water += right_max - height[right]
    right -= 1
```

This solution uses the two-pointer approach efficiently. The key insight is:

1. We maintain two pointers (left and right) and their maximum heights seen so far
2. We always move the pointer pointing to the smaller height
3. If the current height is smaller than the maximum seen from that direction, we can trap water at that position equal to the difference

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the height array, and the space complexity is O(1).

### Binary Search Pattern

#### Problem 5: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or -1 if it is not in `nums`.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- All values of nums are unique
- nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index
- -10^4 <= target <= 10^4

**Question**: Which implementation correctly performs binary search in a rotated sorted array?

```python
def search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid

        ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###

    return -1
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:  # Left portion is sorted
      if nums[left] <= target <= nums[mid]:
          right = mid - 1
      else:
          left = mid + 1
  else:  # Right portion is sorted
      if nums[mid] <= target <= nums[right]:
          left = mid + 1
      else:
          right = mid - 1
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:  # Left portion is sorted
      if nums[left] <= target and target < nums[mid]:
          right = mid - 1
      else:
          left = mid + 1
  else:  # Right portion is sorted
      if nums[mid] < target and target <= nums[right]:
          left = mid + 1
      else:
          right = mid - 1
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  if nums[mid] <= nums[right]:  # Right portion is sorted
      if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
          left = mid + 1
      else:
          right = mid - 1
  else:  # Left portion is sorted
      if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
          right = mid - 1
      else:
          left = mid + 1
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  if target > nums[mid]:
      left = mid + 1
  else:
      right = mid - 1
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:  # Left portion is sorted
    if nums[left] <= target and target < nums[mid]:
        right = mid - 1
    else:
        left = mid + 1
else:  # Right portion is sorted
    if nums[mid] < target and target <= nums[right]:
        left = mid + 1
    else:
        right = mid - 1
```

This implementation correctly handles the rotated sorted array by first determining which half of the array is sorted. Then it checks if the target lies within the sorted portion:

1. If the left half is sorted, check if target is in that range
2. If the right half is sorted, check if target is in that range
3. Move the pointers accordingly to eliminate the half that doesn't contain the target

The time complexity is O(log n) and the space complexity is O(1).

#### Problem 6: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- nums is a non-decreasing array
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9

**Question**: You need to find the first and last position of `target` in a sorted array using binary search. Which implementation correctly finds the first occurrence of the target?

```python
def searchRange(nums, target):
    def find_first():
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        first_pos = -1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###

        return first_pos

    # Implementation for finding last position and overall solution not shown
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  if nums[mid] == target:
      first_pos = mid
      return first_pos
  elif nums[mid] < target:
      left = mid + 1
  else:
      right = mid - 1
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  if nums[mid] == target:
      first_pos = mid
      right = mid - 1
  elif nums[mid] < target:
      left = mid + 1
  else:
      right = mid - 1
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  if nums[mid] == target:
      first_pos = mid
      left = mid + 1
  elif nums[mid] < target:
      left = mid + 1
  else:
      right = mid - 1
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  if nums[mid] == target:
      if mid == 0 or nums[mid-1] != target:
          return mid
      right = mid - 1
  elif nums[mid] < target:
      left = mid + 1
  else:
      right = mid - 1
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
if nums[mid] == target:
    first_pos = mid
    right = mid - 1
elif nums[mid] < target:
    left = mid + 1
else:
    right = mid - 1
```

This implementation correctly finds the first occurrence of the target by continuing to search to the left even after finding a match. Key points:

1. When we find a target match, we update `first_pos` to store the current position
2. We still continue searching in the left half (setting `right = mid - 1`) to find potentially earlier occurrences
3. If the mid value is less than target, we search in the right half
4. If the mid value is greater than target, we search in the left half

This ensures we find the leftmost occurrence of the target in O(log n) time.

### Kadane's Algorithm

#### Problem 7: Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

**Question**: Which implementation correctly uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum?

```python
def maxSubArray(nums):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
    return max_sum
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  max_sum = float('-inf')
  for i in range(len(nums)):
      for j in range(i, len(nums)):
          max_sum = max(max_sum, sum(nums[i:j+1]))
  return max_sum
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  max_sum = current_sum = nums[0]
  for num in nums[1:]:
      current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
      max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
  return max_sum
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  max_sum = 0
  current_sum = 0
  for num in nums:
      current_sum += num
      if current_sum < 0:
          current_sum = 0
      max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
  return max_sum
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  max_sum = float('-inf')
  for window_size in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
      for i in range(len(nums) - window_size + 1):
          max_sum = max(max_sum, sum(nums[i:i+window_size]))
  return max_sum
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
max_sum = current_sum = nums[0]
for num in nums[1:]:
    current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
    max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
return max_sum
```

This is the correct implementation of Kadane's algorithm. The key insights are:

1. We track two variables: `current_sum` (the maximum sum ending at the current position) and `max_sum` (the global maximum subarray sum)
2. For each number, we decide whether to start a new subarray (`num`) or extend the previous subarray (`current_sum + num`)
3. We update the global maximum if the current sum is larger

This handles negative numbers correctly and works when the array contains all negative numbers.

The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).

## Linked List Patterns

### Fast & Slow Pointers

#### Problem 8: Linked List Cycle

Given the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4]
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list

**Question**: Which implementation correctly uses the fast and slow pointer technique to detect a cycle in a linked list?

```python
def hasCycle(head):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  visited = set()
  current = head
  while current:
      if current in visited:
          return True
      visited.add(current)
      current = current.next
  return False
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  if not head or not head.next:
      return False
  slow = head
  fast = head.next
  while slow != fast:
      if not fast or not fast.next:
          return False
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next
  return True
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  slow = fast = head
  while fast and fast.next:
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next
      if slow == fast:
          return True
  return False
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  slow = head
  if not head or not head.next:
      return False
  fast = head.next
  while slow != fast:
      slow = slow.next
      if not fast or not fast.next:
          return False
      fast = fast.next
  return True
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
slow = fast = head
while fast and fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
    if slow == fast:
        return True
return False
```

This implementation correctly uses the Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm):

1. Initialize both `slow` and `fast` pointers to the head
2. Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time
3. If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer
4. If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list (null)

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1) as we're only using two pointers regardless of the list size.

#### Problem 9: Find the Middle of Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100]
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100

**Question**: Which implementation correctly finds the middle node of a linked list using the fast and slow pointer technique?

```python
def middleNode(head):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  slow = fast = head
  while fast and fast.next:
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next
  return slow
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  nodes = []
  current = head
  while current:
      nodes.append(current)
      current = current.next
  return nodes[len(nodes) // 2]
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python

  middle = count // 2
  current = head
  for _ in range(middle):

<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
slow = fast = head
while fast and fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
return slow
```

This implementation efficiently finds the middle of a linked list using two pointers:

1. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time
2. The `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time
3. When the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle

This works for both odd and even length lists. If the list has an even number of nodes, it returns the second middle node as required.

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1).

## Tree Patterns

### Tree Traversal

#### Problem 10: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000]
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

**Question**: Which implementation correctly performs a level order traversal of a binary tree?

```python
def levelOrder(root):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  if not root:
      return []

  result = []
  queue = [root]

  while queue:
      level_size = len(queue)
      level = []

      for _ in range(level_size):
          node = queue.pop(0)
          level.append(node.val)

          if node.left:
              queue.append(node.left)
          if node.right:
              queue.append(node.right)

      result.append(level)

  return result
  ```

  def dfs(node, level):
      if not node:
          return

      if len(result) <= level:
          result.append([])

      result[level].append(node.val)
      dfs(node.left, level + 1)
      dfs(node.right, level + 1)

  dfs(root, 0)
  return result
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  if not root:
      return []

  result = []
  queue = [root]

  while queue:
      node = queue.pop(0)
      result.append(node.val)

      if node.left:
          queue.append(node.left)
      if node.right:
          queue.append(node.right)

  return [result]
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python

  current_level = [root]

  while current_level:
      values = []
      next_level = []

      for node in current_level:
          values.append(node.val)

          if node.left:
              next_level.append(node.left)
          if node.right:
              next_level.append(node.right)

      result.append(values)
      current_level = next_level

  return result
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
if not root:
    return []

result = []
current_level = [root]

while current_level:
    values = []
    next_level = []

    for node in current_level:
        values.append(node.val)

        if node.left:
            next_level.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            next_level.append(node.right)

    result.append(values)
    current_level = next_level

return result
```

This implementation correctly performs a level-order traversal (BFS) of a binary tree:

1. It uses a list to track nodes at the current level
2. For each level, it processes all nodes, collects their values, and gathers their children for the next level
3. It maintains a separate array for each level's values

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

#### Problem 11: Path Sum

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 adds up to 22.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There is no root-to-leaf path that adds up to 5.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 1
Output: false
Explanation: The sum of the path 1->2 is 3, which does not equal 1.
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000]
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
- -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

**Question**: Which implementation correctly determines if there's a path from root to leaf where the sum of values equals `targetSum`?

```python
def hasPathSum(root, targetSum):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  def dfs(node, current_sum):
      if not node:
          return False

      current_sum += node.val

      # If it's a leaf node, check if the sum matches
      if not node.left and not node.right:
          return current_sum == targetSum

      # Check left and right subtrees
      return dfs(node.left, current_sum) or dfs(node.right, current_sum)

  return dfs(root, 0)
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  if not root:
      return False

  targetSum -= root.val

  # If it's a leaf and the remaining sum is 0, we found a valid path
  if not root.left and not root.right:
      return targetSum == 0

  # Check both subtrees
  return hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum) or hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum)
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  stack = [(root, targetSum)]

  while stack:
      node, remaining = stack.pop()
      if not node:
          continue

      remaining -= node.val
      if not node.left and not node.right and remaining == 0:
          return True

      stack.append((node.right, remaining))
      stack.append((node.left, remaining))

  return False
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  if not root:
      return targetSum == 0

  queue = [(root, root.val)]

  while queue:
      node, current_sum = queue.pop(0)

      if not node.left and not node.right and current_sum == targetSum:
          return True

      if node.left:
          queue.append((node.left, current_sum + node.left.val))
      if node.right:
          queue.append((node.right, current_sum + node.right.val))

  return False
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
if not root:
    return False

targetSum -= root.val

# If it's a leaf and the remaining sum is 0, we found a valid path
if not root.left and not root.right:
    return targetSum == 0

# Check both subtrees
return hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum) or hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum)
```

This implementation uses a recursive DFS approach that:

1. Subtracts the current node's value from the target sum
2. Checks if we've reached a leaf node and the remaining sum is 0
3. Recursively checks the left and right subtrees

The approach is elegant and concise while correctly handling all edge cases.

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

## Graph Patterns

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

#### Problem 12: Number of Islands

Given an m x n 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'

**Question**: Which implementation correctly counts the number of islands using BFS?

  for i in range(rows):
      for j in range(cols):

              grid[i][j] = '0'  # Mark as visited

              # BFS to find all connected land cells
              queue = [(i, j)]

<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
if not grid:
    return 0

rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
count = 0

for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(cols):
        if grid[i][j] == '1':
            count += 1
            grid[i][j] = '0'  # Mark as visited

            # BFS to find all connected land cells
            queue = [(i, j)]
            while queue:
                row, col = queue.pop(0)

                # Check all 4 adjacent cells
                directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
                for dr, dc in directions:

                        grid[r][c] = '0'  # Mark as visited

return count
```

This implementation correctly uses BFS to count islands by:

1. Iterating through each cell in the grid
2. When a land cell ('1') is found, incrementing the island count
3. Using BFS to explore all connected land cells and mark them as visited
4. Continuing the process until all cells have been checked

The time complexity is O(mÃ—n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. The space complexity is O(min(m,n)) in the worst case for the queue.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

#### Problem 13: Course Schedule

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

Example 1:

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should have finished course 1. This is impossible.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= numCourses <= 10^5
- 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
- prerequisites[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
- All the pairs [ai, bi] are distinct

<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

for course, prereq in prerequisites:
    graph[prereq].append(course)

# 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited

        if not dfs(next_course):
            return False

    # Mark as completely visited
    visited[course] = 2
    return True

# Check all courses
for course in range(numCourses):
    if not dfs(course):
        return False

return True
```

This implementation correctly:

1. Builds a directed graph where an edge from course A to course B means B depends on A
2. Uses DFS with three states (unvisited, visiting, visited) to detect cycles
3. If a cycle is found, returns false as it's impossible to complete all courses
4. If no cycle is found, returns true

The time complexity is O(V+E) where V is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites. The space complexity is O(V+E) for the graph and visited array.

#### Problem 14: Partition Equal Subset Sum

Given a non-empty array `nums` containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 200
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100

**Question**: Which implementation correctly determines if the array can be partitioned into two equal-sum subsets using dynamic programming?

```python
def canPartition(nums):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  total_sum = sum(nums)

  # If the total sum is odd, we can't partition into equal subsets
  if total_sum % 2 != 0:
      return False

  target = total_sum // 2
  n = len(nums)

  # dp[i][j] = can we make sum j using the first i elements
  dp = [[False] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

  # Base case: we can always make sum 0 with any number of elements
  for i in range(n + 1):
      dp[i][0] = True

  for i in range(1, n + 1):
      for j in range(1, target + 1):
          if j < nums[i-1]:
              # If current number is greater than current sum
              # We can't include it, so use previous result
              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
          else:
              # Either include current number or exclude it
              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] or dp[i-1][j-nums[i-1]]

  return dp[n][target]
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  total_sum = sum(nums)

  # If the total sum is odd, we can't partition into equal subsets
  if total_sum % 2 != 0:
      return False

  target = total_sum // 2

  # dp[j] = can we make sum j
  dp = [False] * (target + 1)
  dp[0] = True

  for num in nums:
      # We need to iterate backwards to avoid using the same element multiple times
      for j in range(target, num - 1, -1):
          dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - num]

  return dp[target]
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  total_sum = sum(nums)

  # If the total sum is odd, we can't partition into equal subsets
  if total_sum % 2 != 0:
      return False

  target = total_sum // 2
  memo = {}

  def dfs(index, remaining):
      # Base case: found a valid subset
      if remaining == 0:
          return True

      # Base case: out of bounds or remaining is negative
      if index >= len(nums) or remaining < 0:
          return False

      # Use memoization
      if (index, remaining) in memo:
          return memo[(index, remaining)]

      # Either include the current number or skip it
      memo[(index, remaining)] = (dfs(index + 1, remaining - nums[index]) or
                                dfs(index + 1, remaining))

      return memo[(index, remaining)]

  return dfs(0, target)
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  total_sum = sum(nums)

  # If the total sum is odd, we can't partition into equal subsets
  if total_sum % 2 != 0:
      return False

  target = total_sum // 2
  dp = set([0])

  for num in nums:
      next_dp = dp.copy()
      for val in dp:
          next_dp.add(val + num)
      dp = next_dp

  return target in dp
  ```

<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
total_sum = sum(nums)

# If the total sum is odd, we can't partition into equal subsets
if total_sum % 2 != 0:
    return False

target = total_sum // 2

# dp[j] = can we make sum j
dp = [False] * (target + 1)
dp[0] = True

for num in nums:
    # We need to iterate backwards to avoid using the same element multiple times
    for j in range(target, num - 1, -1):
        dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - num]

return dp[target]
```

This implementation efficiently solves the problem using a 1D DP approach:

1. It first checks if the total sum is odd (which would make equal partitioning impossible)
2. It uses a boolean DP array where dp[j] represents whether a subset with sum j is possible
3. For each number, it iterates through the DP array backwards to avoid counting the same number multiple times
4. It returns whether a subset with sum equal to half the total is possible

The time complexity is O(n*target) where n is the length of nums and target is half the sum of all elements. The space complexity is O(target).

### Fibonacci Sequence Pattern

#### Problem 15: Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 45

**Question**: Which implementation correctly calculates the number of ways to climb the stairs using a Fibonacci-like dynamic programming approach?

```python
def climbStairs(n):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  # Base cases
  if n <= 0:
      return 0
  if n == 1:
      return 1
  if n == 2:
      return 2

  # Calculate using recursion with memoization
  memo = {}

  def dp(i):
      if i <= 0:
          return 0
      if i == 1:
          return 1
      if i == 2:
          return 2

      if i in memo:
          return memo[i]

      memo[i] = dp(i-1) + dp(i-2)
      return memo[i]

  return dp(n)
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  # Base cases
  if n <= 0:
      return 0
  if n == 1:
      return 1
  if n == 2:
      return 2

  # Calculate using iterative approach
  a, b = 1, 2
  for _ in range(3, n+1):
      a, b = b, a + b

  return b
  ```

- [ ] C.

  ```python
  # Base cases
  if n <= 0:
      return 0
  if n == 1:
      return 1

  # Calculate using DP array
  dp = [0] * (n + 1)
  dp[1] = 1
  dp[2] = 2

  for i in range(3, n + 1):
      dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

  return dp[n]
  ```

- [ ] D.

  ```python
  # Calculate using binomial coefficients
  ways = 0
  for i in range(n // 2 + 1):
      # Choose i positions for 2-steps out of n-i total steps
      from math import comb
      ways += comb(n - i, i)

  return ways
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
# Base cases
if n <= 0:
    return 0
if n == 1:
    return 1
if n == 2:
    return 2

# Calculate using iterative approach
a, b = 1, 2
for _ in range(3, n+1):
    a, b = b, a + b

return b
```

This implementation uses the Fibonacci pattern efficiently:

1. It handles the base cases directly
2. For larger n, it uses an iterative approach with just two variables
3. In each iteration, it updates these variables in a Fibonacci-like sequence
4. It returns the final value which represents the number of ways to climb n stairs

The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1), making it very efficient compared to the recursive or array-based approaches.

## Backtracking Patterns

### Subsets Pattern

#### Problem 16: Subsets

Given an integer array `nums` of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10
- -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
- All the numbers of nums are unique

**Question**: Which implementation correctly generates all subsets using backtracking?

```python
def subsets(nums):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] A.

  ```python
  result = []

  def backtrack(start, current):
      # Add the current subset to the result
      result.append(current[:])

      # Generate all other subsets by adding one more element
      for i in range(start, len(nums)):
          current.append(nums[i])
          backtrack(i + 1, current)
          current.pop()

  backtrack(0, [])
  return result
  ```

- [ ] B.

  ```python
  result = [[]]

  for num in nums:
      result += [curr + [num] for curr in result]

  return result
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  n = len(nums)
  result = []

  # Generate all subsets using bit manipulation
  for i in range(1 << n):  # 2^n combinations
      subset = []
      for j in range(n):
          # Check if jth bit is set in i
          if i & (1 << j):
              subset.append(nums[j])
      result.append(subset)

  return result
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  def recursive_subsets(index):
      if index == len(nums):
          return [[]]

      # Generate all subsets without current element
      subsets_without = recursive_subsets(index + 1)

      # Generate all subsets with current element
      subsets_with = []
      for subset in subsets_without:
          subsets_with.append(subset + [nums[index]])

      # Combine them
      return subsets_without + subsets_with

  return recursive_subsets(0)
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
result = []

def backtrack(start, current):
    # Add the current subset to the result
    result.append(current[:])

    # Generate all other subsets by adding one more element
    for i in range(start, len(nums)):
        current.append(nums[i])
        backtrack(i + 1, current)
        current.pop()

backtrack(0, [])
return result
```

This implementation uses backtracking to generate all possible subsets:

1. It maintains a current subset and adds it to the result at each step
2. It uses a start index to ensure elements are only considered once and in order
3. For each element, it tries both including and excluding it in the current subset
4. It uses backtracking to undo choices and explore all possibilities

The time complexity is O(n * 2^n) where n is the length of nums, as there are 2^n subsets and each may take O(n) time to process. The space complexity is O(n) for the recursion stack.

## Heap Patterns

### Top K Elements Pattern

#### Problem 17: Kth Largest Element in an Array

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

**Question**: Which implementation efficiently finds the kth largest element in an array using a heap?

```python
def findKthLargest(nums, k):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  nums.sort()
  return nums[len(nums) - k]
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  import heapq

  # Use a min heap of size k
  heap = []
  for num in nums:
      if len(heap) < k:
          heapq.heappush(heap, num)
      elif num > heap[0]:
          heapq.heappop(heap)
          heapq.heappush(heap, num)

  return heap[0]
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  import heapq

  # Build a max heap (by negating values)
  heap = [-num for num in nums]
  heapq.heapify(heap)

  # Pop k-1 elements
  for _ in range(k - 1):
      heapq.heappop(heap)

  # Return the kth largest
  return -heapq.heappop(heap)
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  # Use QuickSelect algorithm
  def partition(left, right, pivot_index):
      pivot = nums[pivot_index]
      # Move pivot to the end
      nums[pivot_index], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[pivot_index]

      # Move elements smaller than pivot to the left
      store_index = left
      for i in range(left, right):
          if nums[i] < pivot:
              nums[store_index], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[store_index]
              store_index += 1

      # Move pivot to its final place
      nums[store_index], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[store_index]
      return store_index

  def select(left, right, k_smallest):
      if left == right:
          return nums[left]

      # Choose a random pivot
      import random
      pivot_index = random.randint(left, right)

      # Find the pivot position in a sorted array
      pivot_index = partition(left, right, pivot_index)

      # If the pivot is in the right position
      if k_smallest == pivot_index:
          return nums[k_smallest]
      # If the pivot is larger than k_smallest
      elif k_smallest < pivot_index:
          return select(left, pivot_index - 1, k_smallest)
      # If the pivot is smaller than k_smallest
      else:
          return select(pivot_index + 1, right, k_smallest)

  # Find the kth largest element
  return select(0, len(nums) - 1, len(nums) - k)
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
import heapq

# Use a min heap of size k
heap = []
for num in nums:
    if len(heap) < k:
        heapq.heappush(heap, num)
    elif num > heap[0]:
        heapq.heappop(heap)
        heapq.heappush(heap, num)

return heap[0]
```

This implementation efficiently finds the kth largest element using a min-heap of size k:

1. It maintains a min-heap with the k largest elements seen so far
2. For each new element, if it's larger than the smallest element in the heap, it replaces it
3. After processing all elements, the smallest element in the heap is the kth largest element

The time complexity is O(n log k) where n is the length of nums and k is the given parameter. The space complexity is O(k) for the heap.

This approach is particularly efficient when k is much smaller than n.

## Stack & Queue Patterns

### Stack Applications

#### Problem 18: Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'

**Question**: Which implementation correctly checks if a string has valid parentheses using a stack?

```python
def isValid(s):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  stack = []

  # Map closing brackets to their opening counterparts
  mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}

  for char in s:
      # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack
      if char in '({[':
          stack.append(char)
      # If it's a closing bracket
      elif char in ')}]':
          # If stack is empty or brackets don't match
          if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
              return False

  # Valid if stack is empty (all brackets matched)
  return len(stack) == 0
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  # Count opening and closing brackets
  count_parentheses = 0
  count_brackets = 0
  count_braces = 0

  for char in s:
      if char == '(':
          count_parentheses += 1
      elif char == ')':
          count_parentheses -= 1
      elif char == '[':
          count_brackets += 1
      elif char == ']':
          count_brackets -= 1
      elif char == '{':
          count_braces += 1
      elif char == '}':
          count_braces -= 1

      # If any count becomes negative, brackets are not matched
      if count_parentheses < 0 or count_brackets < 0 or count_braces < 0:
          return False

  # Valid if all counts are 0
  return count_parentheses == 0 and count_brackets == 0 and count_braces == 0
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  # Replace matched pairs until no more replacements can be made
  while '()' in s or '{}' in s or '[]' in s:
      s = s.replace('()', '').replace('{}', '').replace('[]', '')

  # Valid if no brackets remain
  return s == ''
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  def check(s, left, right):
      if left >= right:
          return True

      # Find matching closing bracket

          match = ')'
      elif s[left] == '[':
          match = ']'
      elif s[left] == '{':
          match = '}'
      else:
          return False

      # Find matching closing bracket position
      nested = 1
      for i in range(left + 1, right + 1):
          if s[i] == s[left]:
              nested += 1
          elif s[i] == match:
              nested -= 1
              if nested == 0:
                  # Check substring validity
                  return check(s, left + 1, i - 1) and check(s, i + 1, right)

      return False

  return check(s, 0, len(s) - 1)
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
stack = []

# Map closing brackets to their opening counterparts
mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}

for char in s:
    # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack
    if char in '({[':
        stack.append(char)
    # If it's a closing bracket
    elif char in ')}]':
        # If stack is empty or brackets don't match
        if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
            return False

# Valid if stack is empty (all brackets matched)
return len(stack) == 0
```

This implementation correctly uses a stack to validate parentheses:

1. It pushes opening brackets onto the stack
2. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if it matches the most recent opening bracket
3. If the stack is empty or the brackets don't match, the string is invalid
4. After processing all characters, the string is valid only if all brackets have been matched (stack is empty)

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

### Monotonic Stack

#### Problem 19: Daily Temperatures

Given an array of integers `temperatures` representing daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0`.

Example 1:

```
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5

    stack.append(i)

return answer
```

This implementation uses a monotonic stack to efficiently solve the problem:

1. It maintains a stack of indices of temperatures in decreasing order
2. For each new temperature, it pops elements from the stack while the current temperature is higher
3. For each popped element, it calculates the days to wait as the difference between the current index and the popped index
4. It then pushes the current index onto the stack

This approach ensures that we only process each temperature once, making it efficient.

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the temperatures array. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

#### Problem 20: Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of `s` with length `k`.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "aeiou", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of lowercase English letters
- 1 <= k <= s.length

**Question**: Which implementation correctly finds the maximum number of vowels in a substring of length k?

```python
def maxVowels(s, k):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  vowels = set('aeiou')
  max_count = 0

  for i in range(len(s) - k + 1):
      count = sum(1 for char in s[i:i+k] if char in vowels)
      max_count = max(max_count, count)

  return max_count
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  vowels = set('aeiou')
  current_count = 0

  # Count vowels in the first window
  for i in range(k):
      if s[i] in vowels:
          current_count += 1

  max_count = current_count

  # Slide the window
  for i in range(k, len(s)):
      # Remove the leftmost character
      if s[i-k] in vowels:
          current_count -= 1
      # Add the rightmost character
      if s[i] in vowels:
          current_count += 1

      max_count = max(max_count, current_count)

  return max_count
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  vowels = set('aeiou')
  max_count = 0

  for i in range(len(s)):
      count = 0
      for j in range(i, min(i+k, len(s))):
          if s[j] in vowels:
              count += 1
      max_count = max(max_count, count)

  return max_count
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  vowels = set('aeiou')
  count = 0
  max_count = 0

  for i in range(len(s)):
      if i >= k and s[i-k] in vowels:
          count -= 1
      if s[i] in vowels:
          count += 1
      if i >= k-1:
          max_count = max(max_count, count)

  return max_count
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
vowels = set('aeiou')
current_count = 0

# Count vowels in the first window
for i in range(k):
    if s[i] in vowels:
        current_count += 1

max_count = current_count

# Slide the window
for i in range(k, len(s)):
    # Remove the leftmost character
    if s[i-k] in vowels:
        current_count -= 1
    # Add the rightmost character
    if s[i] in vowels:
        current_count += 1

    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)

return max_count
```

This implementation uses the sliding window technique efficiently:

1. First, it counts the vowels in the initial window of size k
2. Then it slides the window one character at a time
3. For each slide, it removes the contribution of the leftmost character and adds the contribution of the new rightmost character
4. It keeps track of the maximum count seen so far

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(1).

#### Problem 21: Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element

Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number at index 2 (0-indexed), the array becomes [1,1,1], which has 3 consecutive 1's.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number at index 4 (0-indexed), the array becomes [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1], which has 5 consecutive 1's.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You must delete one element.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1

**Question**: Which implementation correctly finds the longest subarray of 1's after deleting exactly one element?

```python
def longestSubarray(nums):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  max_length = 0

  for i in range(len(nums)):
      # Create a new array with the ith element deleted
      new_nums = nums[:i] + nums[i+1:]

      # Find the longest subarray of 1's
      current_length = 0
      longest = 0

      for num in new_nums:
          if num == 1:
              current_length += 1
          else:
              current_length = 0
          longest = max(longest, current_length)

      max_length = max(max_length, longest)

  return max_length
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  left = 0
  zeros = 0
  max_length = 0

  for right in range(len(nums)):
      if nums[right] == 0:
          zeros += 1

      # If we have more than one zero, shrink the window
      while zeros > 1:
          if nums[left] == 0:
              zeros -= 1
          left += 1

      # The window size minus the zero we're allowed to delete
      max_length = max(max_length, right - left)

  # Edge case: if all elements are 1, we must delete one
  return min(max_length, len(nums) - 1)
  ```

      while zeros > 1:
          if nums[left] == 0:
              zeros -= 1
          left += 1

      # Current window size minus the deleted zero
      max_length = max(max_length, right - left)

              count = 0
          groups.append(0)

  if count > 0:
      groups.append(count)

  # Calculate max length after removing one zero
  max_length = 0
  for i in range(len(groups) - 1):
      if groups[i] == 0 or groups[i+1] == 0:
          max_length = max(max_length, groups[i] + groups[i+1])

  # Edge case: all ones
  if len(groups) == 1 and groups[0] > 0:
      return groups[0] - 1

  return max_length
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
left = 0
zeros = 0
max_length = 0

for right in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[right] == 0:
        zeros += 1

    # If we have more than one zero, shrink the window
    while zeros > 1:
        if nums[left] == 0:
            zeros -= 1
        left += 1

    # Current window size minus the deleted zero
    max_length = max(max_length, right - left)

return max_length
```

This implementation uses the sliding window technique with these key insights:

1. We maintain a window that has at most one zero (since we can delete exactly one element)
2. When we encounter a second zero, we shrink the window from the left until we have only one zero again
3. The length of this window minus the one zero is the length of consecutive ones after deletion
4. We keep track of the maximum such length across all positions

The time complexity is O(n) as we process each element at most twice, and the space complexity is O(1).

### Two Pointers Pattern

#### Problem 22: Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example 1:

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

Example 2:

```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

Example 3:

```
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q
merged: a p b q c   d
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters

**Question**: Which implementation correctly merges two strings alternately?

```python
def mergeAlternately(word1, word2):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  result = []
  i, j = 0, 0

  while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2):
      result.append(word1[i])
      result.append(word2[j])
      i += 1
      j += 1

  # Append any remaining characters
  result.append(word1[i:])
  result.append(word2[j:])

  return ''.join(result)
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  result = []
  i = 0

  while i < len(word1) or i < len(word2):
      if i < len(word1):
          result.append(word1[i])
      if i < len(word2):
          result.append(word2[i])
      i += 1

  return ''.join(result)
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  result = []
  i, j = 0, 0

  while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2):
      if i <= j:
          result.append(word1[i])
          i += 1
      else:
          result.append(word2[j])
          j += 1

  # Append any remaining characters
  while i < len(word1):
      result.append(word1[i])
      i += 1

  while j < len(word2):
      result.append(word2[j])
      j += 1

  return ''.join(result)
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  n = min(len(word1), len(word2))
  result = ''

  for i in range(n):
      result += word1[i] + word2[i]

  if len(word1) > n:
      result += word1[n:]
  if len(word2) > n:
      result += word2[n:]

  return result
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
result = []
i = 0

while i < len(word1) or i < len(word2):
    if i < len(word1):
        result.append(word1[i])
    if i < len(word2):
        result.append(word2[i])
    i += 1

return ''.join(result)
```

This implementation correctly merges the two strings in alternating order:

1. It uses a single pointer `i` to iterate through both strings simultaneously
2. For each position, it first adds the character from `word1` (if available) and then the character from `word2` (if available)
3. It continues until it has processed all characters from both strings
4. Finally, it joins all characters to form the merged string

The time complexity is O(m+n) where m and n are the lengths of the two strings. The space complexity is also O(m+n) for storing the result.

#### Problem 23: Move Zeroes

Given an integer array `nums`, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

**Question**: Which implementation correctly moves all zeroes to the end of the array in-place while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements?

```python
def moveZeroes(nums):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  zeros = nums.count(0)
  nums[:] = [num for num in nums if num != 0] + [0] * zeros
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  for i in range(len(nums)):
      if nums[i] == 0:
          nums.append(nums.pop(i))
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  left = 0  # Position to insert non-zero element

  # Move all non-zero elements to the front
  for right in range(len(nums)):
      if nums[right] != 0:
          nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
          left += 1
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  left = 0  # Position to insert non-zero element

  # Move all non-zero elements to the front
  for right in range(len(nums)):
      if nums[right] != 0:
          nums[left] = nums[right]
          left += 1

  # Fill the rest with zeroes
  for i in range(left, len(nums)):
      nums[i] = 0
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
left = 0  # Position to insert non-zero element

# Move all non-zero elements to the front
for right in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[right] != 0:
        nums[left] = nums[right]
        left += 1

# Fill the rest with zeroes
for i in range(left, len(nums)):
    nums[i] = 0
```

This two-pointer approach correctly solves the problem in-place:

1. It uses a `left` pointer to track the position where the next non-zero element should be placed
2. It iterates through the array with a `right` pointer, and whenever it finds a non-zero element, it places it at the `left` position and increments `left`
3. After all non-zero elements are moved to the front (in their original order), it fills the remaining positions with zeroes

The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1), as required by the problem.

#### Problem 24: Is Subsequence

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 100
- 0 <= t.length <= 10^4
- s and t consist only of lowercase English letters

**Question**: Which implementation correctly determines if s is a subsequence of t using a two-pointer approach?

```python
def isSubsequence(s, t):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  i, j = 0, 0

  while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
      if s[i] == t[j]:
          i += 1
      j += 1

  return i == len(s)
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  if not s:
      return True

  pos = 0
  for char in t:
      if pos < len(s) and char == s[pos]:
          pos += 1
      if pos == len(s):
          return True

  return False
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  i = 0

  for char in s:
      i = t.find(char, i)
      if i == -1:
          return False
      i += 1

  return True
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  def check(i, j):
      # Base case: we've matched all chars in s
      if i == len(s):
          return True

      # Base case: we've exhausted t but not s
      if j == len(t):
          return False

      # If current characters match, try matching the rest
      if s[i] == t[j]:
          return check(i+1, j+1)

      # If not, skip this character in t
      return check(i, j+1)

  return check(0, 0)
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
i, j = 0, 0

while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
    if s[i] == t[j]:
        i += 1
    j += 1

return i == len(s)
```

This implementation uses a two-pointer approach:

1. It maintains two pointers, `i` for string `s` and `j` for string `t`
2. It iterates through both strings simultaneously
3. When it finds a matching character, it advances the pointer for `s`
4. It always advances the pointer for `t` after each comparison
5. If all characters in `s` were matched (i.e., `i` equals the length of `s`), then `s` is a subsequence of `t`

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of string `t`. The space complexity is O(1) as no extra space is used.

### Prefix Sum Pattern

#### Problem 25: Find Pivot Index

Given an array of integers `nums`, calculate the pivot index of this array.

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [2,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The pivot index is 0.
Left sum = 0 (no elements to the left of index 0)
Right sum = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + -1 = 0
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

**Question**: Which implementation correctly finds the pivot index using a prefix sum approach?

```python
def pivotIndex(nums):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  for i in range(len(nums)):
      if sum(nums[:i]) == sum(nums[i+1:]):
          return i
  return -1
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  # Calculate the total sum
  total_sum = sum(nums)
  left_sum = 0

  for i, num in enumerate(nums):
      # Right sum is the total sum minus the left sum and the current element
      if left_sum == total_sum - left_sum - num:
          return i

      left_sum += num

  return -1
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  # Calculate prefix and suffix sums
  prefix = [nums[0]]
  for i in range(1, len(nums)):
      prefix.append(prefix[-1] + nums[i])

  suffix = [nums[-1]]
  for i in range(len(nums)-2, -1, -1):
      suffix.append(suffix[-1] + nums[i])
  suffix.reverse()

  # Find pivot index
  for i in range(len(nums)):
      left = prefix[i-1] if i > 0 else 0
      right = suffix[i+1] if i < len(nums)-1 else 0

      if left == right:
          return i

  return -1
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  left_sum = 0
  right_sum = sum(nums)

  for i, num in enumerate(nums):
      right_sum -= num

      if left_sum == right_sum:
          return i

      left_sum += num

  return -1
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
# Calculate the total sum
total_sum = sum(nums)
left_sum = 0

for i, num in enumerate(nums):
    # Right sum is the total sum minus the left sum and the current element
    if left_sum == total_sum - left_sum - num:
        return i

    left_sum += num

return -1
```

This implementation efficiently finds the pivot index using a prefix sum approach:

1. It first calculates the total sum of all elements
2. It then iterates through the array, maintaining a running left sum
3. For each index, the right sum can be efficiently calculated as the total sum minus the left sum and the current element
4. If the left sum equals the right sum, we've found a pivot index
5. If no such index is found, it returns -1

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the array. We spend O(n) time calculating the initial sum and O(n) time traversing the array once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.

#### Problem 26: Find the Highest Altitude

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length n where `gain[i]` is the net gain in altitude between points `i` and `i + 1` for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

Example 1:

```
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
```

Constraints:

- n == gain.length
- 1 <= n <= 100
- -100 <= gain[i] <= 100

**Question**: Which implementation correctly finds the highest altitude using a prefix sum approach?

<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
current = 0
highest = 0

for g in gain:
    current += g
    highest = max(highest, current)

return highest
```

This implementation efficiently finds the highest altitude:

1. It keeps track of the current altitude as it traverses the gain array
2. It updates the highest altitude seen so far at each step
3. Since we start at altitude 0, we include 0 in our consideration for the highest altitude

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the gain array. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use two variables regardless of the input size.

### Dynamic Programming Patterns

#### Problem 27: Min Cost Climbing Stairs

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of the ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

Example 1:

```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= cost.length <= 1000
- 0 <= cost[i] <= 999

**Question**: Which implementation correctly calculates the minimum cost to climb the stairs?

```python
def minCostClimbingStairs(cost):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  # Handle base cases
  if len(cost) <= 1:
      return 0

  # Initialize dp array
  dp = [0] * (len(cost) + 1)

  # Build up solution from bottom to top
  for i in range(2, len(cost) + 1):
      dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + cost[i-1], dp[i-2] + cost[i-2])

  return dp[len(cost)]
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  def min_cost(i, memo={}):
      # Base cases
      if i <= 1:
          return 0

      # Check if already calculated
      if i in memo:
          return memo[i]

      # Calculate minimum cost to reach step i
      memo[i] = min(min_cost(i-1, memo) + cost[i-1],
                    min_cost(i-2, memo) + cost[i-2])

      return memo[i]

  return min_cost(len(cost))
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  n = len(cost)
  dp = [0] * n

  dp[0] = cost[0]
  dp[1] = cost[1]

  for i in range(2, n):
      dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])

  return min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  # We can optimize to O(1) space
  first = cost[0]
  second = cost[1]

  for i in range(2, len(cost)):
      current = cost[i] + min(first, second)
      first = second
      second = current

  return min(first, second)
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
n = len(cost)
dp = [0] * n

dp[0] = cost[0]
dp[1] = cost[1]

for i in range(2, n):
    dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])

return min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])
```

This dynamic programming approach correctly solves the problem:

1. It initializes a DP array where dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach step i
2. The base cases are dp[0] = cost[0] and dp[1] = cost[1]
3. For each subsequent step, the minimum cost is the cost of the current step plus the minimum of the costs to reach the previous one or two steps
4. Since we can reach the top from either the last or second-to-last step, we return the minimum of dp[n-1] and dp[n-2]

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the cost array. The space complexity is O(n) for the DP array.

Note: The optimized O(1) space solution is also correct, but we chose the more illustrative DP array solution for clarity.

#### Problem 28: House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 400

**Question**: Which implementation correctly solves the House Robber problem using dynamic programming?

```python
def rob(nums):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  if not nums:
      return 0

  if len(nums) == 1:
      return nums[0]

  dp = [0] * len(nums)
  dp[0] = nums[0]
  dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

  for i in range(2, len(nums)):
      dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])

  return dp[-1]
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  if not nums:
      return 0

  # Only two houses
  if len(nums) <= 2:
      return max(nums)

  # More than two houses
  rob1 = nums[0]
  rob2 = max(nums[0], nums[1])

  for i in range(2, len(nums)):
      current = max(rob2, rob1 + nums[i])
      rob1 = rob2
      rob2 = current

  return rob2
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  def rob_helper(nums, i, memo={}):
      if i >= len(nums):
          return 0

      if i in memo:
          return memo[i]

      # Either rob current house and skip next, or skip current house
      memo[i] = max(nums[i] + rob_helper(nums, i+2, memo),
                    rob_helper(nums, i+1, memo))

      return memo[i]

  return rob_helper(nums, 0)
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  even_sum = 0
  odd_sum = 0

  for i in range(len(nums)):
      if i % 2 == 0:
          even_sum += nums[i]
      else:
          odd_sum += nums[i]

  return max(even_sum, odd_sum)
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
if not nums:
    return 0

if len(nums) == 1:
    return nums[0]

dp = [0] * len(nums)
dp[0] = nums[0]
dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

for i in range(2, len(nums)):
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])

return dp[-1]
```

This dynamic programming solution correctly handles the House Robber problem:

1. It covers edge cases where there are 0 or 1 houses
2. For each house, we decide whether to rob it by comparing:
   - The maximum amount if we don't rob the current house (dp[i-1])
   - The maximum amount if we rob the current house, which is the value of the current house plus the maximum amount if we didn't rob the previous house (dp[i-2] + nums[i])
3. We build this decision for each house and return the maximum amount from the last house

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of houses. The space complexity is O(n) for the DP array.

Note: The solution with O(1) space complexity that uses two variables (rob1 and rob2) is also correct, but we chose the more illustrative DP array solution for clarity.

## Tree Patterns

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

#### Problem 29: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4]
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

**Question**: Which implementation correctly calculates the maximum depth of a binary tree?

```python
def maxDepth(root):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  if not root:
      return 0

  return 1 + max(maxDepth(root.left), maxDepth(root.right))
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  if not root:
      return 0

  # BFS approach
  queue = [(root, 1)]  # (node, depth)
  max_depth = 0

  while queue:
      node, depth = queue.pop(0)
      max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)

      if node.left:
          queue.append((node.left, depth + 1))
      if node.right:
          queue.append((node.right, depth + 1))

  return max_depth
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  def dfs(node, depth):
      # Base case: leaf node
      if not node:
          return depth

      # Recursively check left and right subtrees
      left_depth = dfs(node.left, depth + 1)
      right_depth = dfs(node.right, depth + 1)

      return max(left_depth, right_depth)

  return dfs(root, 0)
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  if not root:
      return 0

  # Iterative DFS using stack
  stack = [(root, 1)]  # (node, depth)
  max_depth = 0

  while stack:
      node, depth = stack.pop()
      max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)

      if node.right:
          stack.append((node.right, depth + 1))
      if node.left:
          stack.append((node.left, depth + 1))

  return max_depth
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
if not root:
    return 0

return 1 + max(maxDepth(root.left), maxDepth(root.right))
```

This is the most elegant and concise recursive DFS solution:

1. If the tree is empty (root is null), the depth is 0
2. Otherwise, the depth is 1 (counting the root node) plus the maximum depth of either the left or right subtree
3. This recurses down the tree, calculating the depth of each subtree

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

#### Problem 30: Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

Given a binary tree `root`, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3,3,2) is not good, because the maximum value in the path from root to 2 is 3.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5]
- Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4]

**Question**: Which implementation correctly counts the number of good nodes in a binary tree?

```python
def goodNodes(root):
    ### YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE ###
```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  def dfs(node, max_so_far):

      count = 1 if node.val >= max_so_far else 0

      # Update max value for children
      max_so_far = max(max_so_far, node.val)

      # Count good nodes in left and right subtrees
      count += dfs(node.left, max_so_far)
      count += dfs(node.right, max_so_far)

      return count

  return dfs(root, float('-inf'))
  ```

  ```python
  if not root:
      return 0

  # BFS
  queue = [(root, root.val)]  # (node, max value so far)

      node, max_val = queue.pop(0)

      # Check if current node is good
      if node.val >= max_val:
          good_count += 1

      # Update max value for children
      max_val = max(max_val, node.val)

          queue.append((node.left, max_val))
      if node.right:
          queue.append((node.right, max_val))

  return good_count
  ```

- [ ] .

  ```python
  def count_good(node, path):
      if not node:
          return 0

      # Add current node to path
      path.append(node.val)

      # Check if current node is good
      is_good = all(node.val >= val for val in path[:-1])

      # Recursively count good nodes in subtrees
      count = (1 if is_good else 0) + count_good(node.left, path[:]) + count_good(node.right, path[:])

      return count

  return count_good(root, [])
  ```

      # Add current node to ancestors for children
      ancestors.append(node.val)

      # Recursively count good nodes in subtrees
      count += dfs(node.left, ancestors) + dfs(node.right, ancestors)

      # Remove current node from ancestors before returning
      ancestors.pop()

      return count

  return dfs(root, [])
  ```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The correct answer is:

```python
def dfs(node, max_so_far):
    if not node:
        return 0

    # Current node is good if it's >= max value seen so far
    count = 1 if node.val >= max_so_far else 0

    # Update max value for children
    max_so_far = max(max_so_far, node.val)

    # Count good nodes in left and right subtrees
    count += dfs(node.left, max_so_far)
    count += dfs(node.right, max_so_far)

    return count

return dfs(root, float('-inf'))
```

This implementation efficiently counts good nodes using DFS:

1. It tracks the maximum value seen so far in the path from the root to the current node
2. A node is "good" if its value is greater than or equal to the maximum value seen so far
3. It recursively explores the left and right subtrees, updating the maximum value for each path
4. It counts and sums up all the good nodes in the tree

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
