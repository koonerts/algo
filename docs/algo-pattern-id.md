# Sliding Window

**How to Identify:**

- Problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings
- Finding max/min/sum over a contiguous sequence of fixed or variable size
- Problems asking for longest/shortest subarray with a given property

**Example Problem Types:**

- Maximum sum subarray of size K
- Longest substring with K distinct characters
- Minimum size subarray with a given sum
- String permutations or anagrams

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(n) where n is array length (each element processed at most twice)
- Space: O(1) for fixed window, O(k) where k is window size for variable window

**How to Solve:**

1. **Initialize Window:** Set `left` and `right` pointers to the start (usually 0). Initialize necessary data structures (e.g., hash map for counts, current sum).
2. **Expand Window:** Move the `right` pointer one step to include a new element in the window. Update data structures/variables based on the new element.
3. **Check Condition:** Evaluate if the current window satisfies the problem's constraints or properties.
4. **Update Result:** If the condition is met, update the overall result (e.g., maximum sum, minimum length).
5. **Shrink Window (If Necessary):** If the window violates constraints (e.g., size exceeds K, too many distinct characters), move the `left` pointer inward, removing elements from the window's start. Update data structures accordingly until the window is valid again.
6. **Repeat:** Continue expanding (`right++`) and shrinking (`left++`) until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the input.
7. **Return Result:** Return the final computed result.

# Array Patterns

### Two Pointers

**How to Identify:**

- Problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists
- Need to find pairs or triplets satisfying certain conditions
- Problems asking for in-place array modification
- Finding intersections or palindromes

**Example Problem Types:**

- Two Sum, Three Sum
- Container with Most Water
- Remove duplicates from sorted array
- Palindrome verification

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(n) for most implementations or O(nÂ²) for nested two pointers
- Space: O(1) as typically implemented in-place

**How to Solve:**

1. **Initialize Pointers:** Determine the starting positions for your pointers based on the problem (e.g., `left = 0`, `right = n-1` for opposite ends; `slow = 0`, `fast = 0` for same end).
2. **Define Movement Logic:** Decide how pointers should move based on comparisons or conditions (e.g., if `sum < target`, `left++`; if `sum > target`, `right--`).
3. **Loop Condition:** Establish the condition for the loop to continue (e.g., `while left < right`, `while fast < n`).
4. **Process Elements:** Inside the loop, perform comparisons or calculations using the elements at the pointer positions. Update results or modify the array/list as needed.
5. **Move Pointers:** Apply the movement logic defined in step 2.
6. **Termination:** Ensure the loop terminates correctly and handle any remaining edge cases after the loop.
7. **Return Result:** Return the computed value or the modified data structure.

**How to Solve:**

1. **Initialize:** Set `current_max` and `global_max` to the value of the first element in the array.
2. **Iterate:** Loop through the array starting from the second element (`i = 1` to `n-1`).
3. **Update `current_max`:** For each element `arr[i]`, decide whether to extend the current subarray or start a new one: `current_max = max(arr[i], current_max + arr[i])`.
4. **Update `global_max`:** Update the overall maximum sum found so far: `global_max = max(global_max, current_max)`.
5. **Return:** After the loop finishes, `global_max` holds the maximum subarray sum.

### Prefix Sums

**How to Identify:**

- Range sum queries
- Cumulative operations on arrays

- Space: O(n) for storing prefix sums

**How to Solve:**

1. **Preprocessing:**
   * Create a prefix sum array `prefix_sum` of size `n+1`. Initialize `prefix_sum[0] = 0`.
   * Iterate from `i = 1` to `n`: `prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + array[i-1]`.
2. **Range Sum Query (index `i` to `j` inclusive):**
   * The sum is `prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i]`.
3. **Subarray Sum Equals K:**
   * Use a hash map `counts` to store frequencies of prefix sums encountered so far (`counts[0] = 1`).
   * Iterate through the array, calculating the current `current_sum`.
   * Check if `current_sum - K` exists in the `counts` map. If yes, add `counts[current_sum - K]` to the total count of valid subarrays.
   * Increment the frequency of `current_sum` in the `counts` map.

2. **Movement:** Inside a loop, advance `slow` by one node (`slow = slow.next`) and `fast` by two nodes (`fast = fast.next.next`).
3. **Termination/Check:**
   * **Cycle Detection:** The loop condition should check for `fast` and `fast.next` not being null. If `slow == fast` at any point, a cycle exists.
   * **Finding Middle:** The loop condition is `while fast and fast.next`. When the loop terminates, `slow` will be at the middle (or the first of two middle nodes for even length).
   * **Nth from End:** Initialize `fast` `n` steps ahead of `slow`. Then move both one step at a time until `fast` reaches the end. `slow` will be at the Nth node from the end.

2. **Iterate:** While `current` is not null:
   * Store the next node: `next_node = current.next`.
   * Reverse the current node's pointer: `current.next = prev`.
   * Move `prev` one step forward: `prev = current`.
   * Move `current` one step forward: `current = next_node`.
3. **Return:** The new head of the reversed list is `prev`.

**How to Solve (Recursive):**

1. **Base Case:** If `head` is null or `head.next` is null, return `head`.

## Dynamic Programming Patterns

### 0/1 Knapsack Pattern

**How to Identify:**

- Discrete items with values/weights
- Binary decisions (include/exclude)
- Maximizing/minimizing value with constraints

**Example Problem Types:**

- 0/1 Knapsack
- Subset Sum
- Equal Subset Sum Partition
- Minimum Subset Sum Difference

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(n * C) where n is items, C is capacity
- Space: O(n * C), can be optimized to O(C)

**How to Solve (2D DP):**

1. **Initialization:** Create a DP table `dp[n+1][C+1]`. `dp[i][c]` represents the max value using first `i` items with capacity `c`. Initialize all to 0.
2. **Iteration:** Loop through items `i` from 1 to `n`. Loop through capacities `c` from 1 to `C`.
3. **Decision:**
   * If `weight[i-1] <= c` (current item `i-1` fits):
     * `dp[i][c] = max(dp[i-1][c], value[i-1] + dp[i-1][c - weight[i-1]])`
     * (Max of not including item `i-1` vs. including item `i-1`)
   * Else (current item `i-1` doesn't fit):
     * `dp[i][c] = dp[i-1][c]` (must not include item `i-1`)
4. **Result:** `dp[n][C]` contains the maximum value.

**How to Solve (1D DP - Space Optimized):**

1. **Initialization:** Create a DP array `dp[C+1]`. Initialize all to 0.
2. **Iteration:** Loop through items `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Loop through capacities `c` from `C` down to `weight[i]`.
3. **Decision:** `dp[c] = max(dp[c], value[i] + dp[c - weight[i]])`.
4. **Result:** `dp[C]` contains the maximum value. (Iterating `c` downwards prevents using the same item multiple times within the same outer loop iteration).

### Unbounded Knapsack Pattern

**How to Identify:**

- Items can be used multiple times
- Selecting repeated elements with constraints
- Max/min value problems with unlimited supply

**Example Problem Types:**

- Coin Change (min coins)
- Coin Change II (number of ways)
- Rod Cutting
- Maximum ribbon cut

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(n * C) where n is item types, C is capacity
- Space: O(C)

**How to Solve (1D DP):**

1. **Initialization:** Create a DP array `dp[C+1]`. Initialize `dp[0] = 0` and others to a value indicating impossibility (e.g., infinity for min coins, 0 for max value/ways). For counting ways, `dp[0] = 1`.
2. **Iteration (Order 1 - Item Outer Loop):** Loop through items `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Loop through capacities `c` from `weight[i]` up to `C`.
   * **Decision (Max Value):** `dp[c] = max(dp[c], value[i] + dp[c - weight[i]])`.
   * **Decision (Min Coins):** `dp[c] = min(dp[c], 1 + dp[c - weight[i]])`.
   * **Decision (Count Ways):** `dp[c] = dp[c] + dp[c - weight[i]]`.
3. **Iteration (Order 2 - Capacity Outer Loop - Use if item order matters or for specific problems):** Loop through capacities `c` from 1 to `C`. Loop through items `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   * If `c >= weight[i]`: Apply the decision logic as above.
4. **Result:** `dp[C]` contains the answer. Check for the initial impossibility value if necessary. (Iterating `c` upwards allows using the same item multiple times).

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(m * n) where m, n are string lengths
- Space: O(m * n), can be optimized to O(min(m, n))

**How to Solve (2D DP):**

1. **Initialization:** Create a DP table `dp[m+1][n+1]`. `dp[i][j]` represents the LCS length for `text1[0...i-1]` and `text2[0...j-1]`. Initialize first row and column to 0.
2. **Iteration:** Loop through `i` from 1 to `m`. Loop through `j` from 1 to `n`.
3. **Decision:**
   * If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]`:
     * `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]` (Characters match, extend LCS from previous diagonal).
   * Else (Characters don't match):
     * `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])` (Take the max LCS length from excluding char `i` or excluding char `j`).
4. **Result:** `dp[m][n]` contains the length of the LCS. (To reconstruct the LCS string, backtrack from `dp[m][n]`).

**How to Solve (Space Optimized):**

1. Use two rows (or `min(m, n)` columns) of the DP table to store only the current and previous row's results, reducing space. Update iteratively.

**How to Identify:**

- Problems with recursive relation f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
- Current state depends on 1-2 previous states
- Counting distinct ways to reach a target

**Example Problem Types:**

- Fibonacci Numbers
- Staircase
- House Thief (similar to non-adjacent elements)
- Jump Game variations

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n) can be optimized to O(1)

**How to Solve (Tabulation - O(n) Space):**

1. **Initialization:** Create a DP array `dp` of size `n+1` (or appropriate size based on the problem).
2. **Base Cases:** Initialize the first few values of `dp` based on the problem's base conditions (e.g., `dp[0] = 0`, `dp[1] = 1` for Fibonacci; `dp[0]=1`, `dp[1]=1` for climbing stairs).
3. **Iteration:** Loop from the first non-base case index up to `n`.
4. **Recurrence:** Calculate `dp[i]` using the identified recurrence relation involving previous `dp` values (e.g., `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`).
5. **Result:** `dp[n]` contains the answer.

**How to Solve (Space Optimized - O(1) Space):**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize variables to store the necessary previous states (e.g., `prev2 = base_case_0`, `prev1 = base_case_1`).
2. **Iteration:** Loop from the first non-base case index up to `n`.
3. **Recurrence:** Calculate the `current` state using the recurrence relation involving `prev1` and `prev2`.
4. **Update:** Shift the previous states: `prev2 = prev1`, `prev1 = current`.
5. **Result:** After the loop, `prev1` (or `current`) holds the answer for `n`.

## Backtracking Patterns

### Subsets Pattern

**How to Identify:**

- Generating all possible subsets/combinations/permutations
- Need to explore multiple choices at each step
- Building combinations with specific constraints

**Example Problem Types:**

- Generate Subsets/Powerset
- Permutations
- Combinations
- Letter Combinations of Phone Number

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(2^n) for subsets, O(n!) for permutations
- Space: O(n) for recursion stack

**How to Solve (General Backtracking Template):**

1. **Initialization:** Create a list `results` to store valid combinations/permutations.
2. **Define Helper Function:** `backtrack(start_index, current_combination, ...)`
   * `start_index`: The index in the input array/string to start considering elements from (prevents duplicate combinations). For permutations, this might not be needed or used differently.
   * `current_combination`: The subset/permutation being built.
3. **Base Case / Add to Results:** Determine when a valid combination is formed (e.g., reached desired size, processed all elements). If valid, add a copy of `current_combination` to `results`.
4. **Recursive Step / Exploration:** Iterate through possible choices starting from `start_index` (for combinations) or all elements (for permutations, managing used elements).
   * **Choose:** Add the chosen element to `current_combination`. Mark as used if necessary (for permutations).
   * **Explore:** Recursively call `backtrack` with updated parameters (e.g., `backtrack(i + 1, current_combination, ...)` for combinations; `backtrack(current_combination, ...)` for permutations).
   * **Unchoose (Backtrack):** Remove the chosen element from `current_combination`. Unmark as used if necessary.
5. **Initial Call:** Start the process by calling `backtrack(0, [], ...)`.
6. **Return:** Return `results`.

### Constraint Satisfaction Pattern

**How to Identify:**

- Problems with complex constraints
- Search space can be pruned early
- Need to find all valid solutions or one valid solution

**Example Problem Types:**

- N-Queens
- Sudoku Solver
- Word Search
- Palindrome Partitioning

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: Exponential, but pruning reduces actual runtime
- Space: O(n) for recursion stack

**How to Solve:**

1. **Represent State:** Define how to represent the current state of the problem (e.g., the Sudoku board, the positions of N-Queens, the current path in a grid).
2. **Define Helper Function:** `backtrack(current_state)`
3. **Base Case (Goal Reached):** Check if `current_state` represents a complete and valid solution. If yes, add it to results or return `true`.
4. **Find Next Decision Point:** Identify the next choice to make (e.g., the next empty cell in Sudoku, the next column for N-Queens).
5. **Iterate Through Choices:** Loop through all possible valid choices for the current decision point.
   * **Check Validity:** Before making a choice, verify if it satisfies all problem constraints given the `current_state`.
   * **Choose:** If valid, apply the choice to update the state (`new_state`).
   * **Explore:** Recursively call `backtrack(new_state)`.
     * If the recursive call returns `true` (found a solution), propagate `true` upwards.
   * **Unchoose (Backtrack):** Revert the state back to `current_state` (undo the choice).
6. **Base Case (Dead End):** If no choice leads to a solution from the `current_state`, return `false`.
7. **Initial Call:** Start with the initial state of the problem.

## Heap Patterns

### Top K Elements Pattern

**How to Identify:**

- Finding top/smallest K elements
- Stream processing with limited memory
- Maintaining a running set of maximum/minimum elements

**Example Problem Types:**

- Kth Largest Element
- K Closest Points to Origin
- Top K Frequent Elements
- Sort K-sorted Array

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(n log k) for processing n elements with heap of size k
- Space: O(k) for the heap

**How to Solve (Top K Largest):**

1. **Initialization:** Create a min-heap of size `k`.
2. **Iteration:** Loop through the input elements `num`.
   * Push `num` onto the heap.
   * If the heap size exceeds `k`, pop the smallest element (`heap.pop()`).
3. **Result:** After iterating through all elements, the heap contains the `k` largest elements. The root (`heap.peek()`) is the Kth largest element.

**How to Solve (Top K Smallest):**

1. **Initialization:** Create a max-heap of size `k`.
2. **Iteration:** Loop through the input elements `num`.
   * Push `num` onto the heap.
   * If the heap size exceeds `k`, pop the largest element (`heap.pop()`).
3. **Result:** After iterating through all elements, the heap contains the `k` smallest elements. The root (`heap.peek()`) is the Kth smallest element.

**Note:** For frequency problems, first count frequencies using a hash map, then use the heap on the (frequency, element) pairs or just the frequencies/elements depending on the goal.

### Two Heaps Pattern

**How to Identify:**

- Median calculation problems
- Balancing elements on either side of a midpoint
- Processing stream data with statistics

**Example Problem Types:**

- Find Median from Data Stream
- Sliding Window Median
- IPO (maximize capital)

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(log n) per element insertion
- Space: O(n) for storing all elements

**How to Solve (Find Median):**

1. **Initialization:**
   * Create a max-heap `small_half` (stores the smaller half of numbers).
   * Create a min-heap `large_half` (stores the larger half of numbers).
2. **`addNum(num)` Function:**
   * Add `num` to `small_half`.
   * **Balance Step 1:** Ensure every number in `small_half` is <= every number in `large_half`. If `small_half.peek() > large_half.peek()` (and both heaps are non-empty), pop from `small_half` and push to `large_half`.
   * **Balance Step 2:** Ensure heap sizes differ by at most 1.
     * If `small_half.size() > large_half.size() + 1`, pop from `small_half` and push to `large_half`.
     * If `large_half.size() > small_half.size() + 1`, pop from `large_half` and push to `small_half`.
3. **`findMedian()` Function:**
   * If `small_half.size() > large_half.size()`, median is `small_half.peek()`.
   * If `large_half.size() > small_half.size()`, median is `large_half.peek()`.
   * If `small_half.size() == large_half.size()`, median is `(small_half.peek() + large_half.peek()) / 2.0`.

## Additional Patterns

### Binary Search Variations

**How to Identify:**

- Sorted arrays or matrix
- Problems where search space can be halved each time
- Finding exact match or closest element
- Monotonically increasing/decreasing properties

**Example Problem Types:**

- Standard binary search
- Search in rotated sorted array
- Search for a range
- Find minimum in rotated sorted array

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(log n)
- Space: O(1) iterative, O(log n) recursive

**How to Solve (Standard):**

1. **Initialization:** Set `low = 0`, `high = n - 1` (or appropriate bounds for the search space).
2. **Loop:** While `low <= high`:
   * Calculate `mid = low + (high - low) // 2` (prevents overflow).
   * **Comparison:**
     * If `array[mid] == target`, return `mid` (or `true`).
     * If `array[mid] < target`, the target must be in the right half: `low = mid + 1`.
     * If `array[mid] > target`, the target must be in the left half: `high = mid - 1`.
3. **Not Found:** If the loop finishes, the target was not found. Return `-1` (or `false`).

**How to Solve (Variations - e.g., Rotated Array, Find Boundary):**

1. **Initialization:** Set `low`, `high` bounds.
2. **Loop:** While `low <= high` (or sometimes `low < high` for boundary finding).
3. **Calculate `mid`.**
4. **Condition Check:** Instead of direct comparison with `target`, check conditions based on the problem's properties (e.g., `array[mid] >= array[low]` to find the sorted half in a rotated array, or `isBadVersion(mid)` for first bad version).
5. **Adjust Bounds:** Based on the condition check, decide whether to discard the left half (`low = mid + 1`) or the right half (`high = mid - 1` or `high = mid`). The exact adjustment depends heavily on the specific problem and whether you are looking for the first/last occurrence or any occurrence.
6. **Return:** Return `low` or `high` (often the boundary) or the result found during the loop. Carefully consider the loop termination condition and which pointer holds the answer.

### Greedy Algorithms

**How to Identify:**

- Local optimal choice leads to global optimum
- Problems where you can make choices without reconsidering
- Optimization problems with "obvious" next steps

**Example Problem Types:**

- Activity selection
- Huffman coding
- Fractional knapsack
- Interval scheduling

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: Usually O(n log n) due to sorting
- Space: Usually O(1) or O(n)

**How to Solve:**

1. **Identify Greedy Choice:** Determine a rule for making the best local choice at each step. This often involves sorting the input based on some criteria (e.g., end times for interval scheduling, value/weight ratio for fractional knapsack).
2. **Prove Correctness (Optional but Recommended):** Try to argue why the greedy choice always leads to a globally optimal solution (e.g., "stays ahead" argument, exchange argument).
3. **Sort (If Necessary):** Sort the input data according to the chosen greedy criterion.
4. **Iterate and Choose:** Loop through the sorted data, making the greedy choice at each step and building the solution incrementally. Maintain any necessary state (e.g., current time, available capacity).
5. **Return Result:** Return the constructed solution or the optimal value found.

### Bit Manipulation

**How to Identify:**

- Problems involving binary representation
- XOR, AND, OR operations
- Problems requiring space optimization
- Numeric problems that can exploit bit properties

**Example Problem Types:**

- Counting bits
- Finding single number among duplicates
- Power set generation via bits
- Bit manipulation tricks

**Time & Space Complexity:**

- Time: O(1) to O(n) depending on problem
- Space: Usually O(1)

**How to Solve:**

1. **Understand Operators:** Know the function of `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `<<` (Left Shift), `>>` (Right Shift).
2. **Identify Goal:** Determine what needs to be achieved (e.g., find unique number, count set bits, check power of 2, set/clear/toggle a bit).
3. **Choose Operator(s):** Select the appropriate bitwise operator(s) for the task.
   * `^` (XOR): Useful for finding differences, toggling bits, finding unique elements (since `x ^ x = 0` and `x ^ 0 = x`).
   * `&` (AND): Useful for checking if a bit is set (`num & (1 << k)`), clearing bits (`num & ~(1 << k)`), masking.
   * `|` (OR): Useful for setting bits (`num | (1 << k)`).
   * `<<`, `>>`: Useful for multiplying/dividing by powers of 2, iterating through bits.
   * `~` (NOT): Useful for inverting bits, often used with AND for clearing.
4. **Apply Logic:** Implement the solution using the chosen operators, often within loops or conditional statements.
5. **Handle Edge Cases:** Consider negative numbers (two's complement representation) and potential overflows if applicable.
